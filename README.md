# Advent of Code - 2023

This year, in Ruby ðŸ’Ž

## Setup AoC

For convenience, I've made myself the `./setup_aoc.rb` script to set up the file and directory structure.

It only needs a single input, which is the file extension of the language in which you will be solving
Advent of Code this year as an environment variable:

```bash
AOC_FILE_EXTENSION="rb" ./setup_aoc.rb
```
